Capstone day one:
---Reviewed Ruby lessons and Marios project for areas I should focus on in the creation of my projects code.
---Still studying and beginning to program
---Add rails project for possible modification
---Investigate REI website: They appear to use a react frontend so I will try to do the same
---Found walkthrough for React with API Server: (https://dev.to/jerodimusprime/building-dynamic-react-apps-with-database-data-3apo)
